## iOS Application

![Machbarschaft Logo](logo.jpeg)

Project Machbarschaft was created in the context of [WirVsVirus Hackathon](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/) hosted by the German Government. Our pitch video can be found [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YJ0I0dMmWg). We also have a [Devpost Profile](https://devpost.com/software/einanrufhilft) and a website [machbarschaft.jetzt](https://machbarschaft.jetzt/).

This repository contains the Android Application which is meant for the helper, to find nearby help seeking persons. New Users have to verify their Identiy with Passbase(ID - Verfication) and SMS. Afterwards they can help others in need.
