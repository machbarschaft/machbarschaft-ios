# iOS Application
Project Machbarschaft was created in the context of [WirVsVirus Hackathon](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/) hosted by the German Government. Our pitch video can be found [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YJ0I0dMmWg). We also have a [Devpost profile](https://devpost.com/software/einanrufhilft) and a website [machbarschaft.jetzt](https://machbarschaft.jetzt/).

This repository contains the Android Application which is meant for the helper, to find nearby help seeking persons. New users have to verify their identiy with Passbase (verfication by ID) and SMS. Afterwards they can help others who are in need. 

## Demo
We have recorded a short video to demonstrate the current state of the app:

1. Install the MACHBARSCHAFT app to your iOS device.
2. Click "Register" and fill the form with your personal data. 
3. You will get a SMS with a code from us. Type in this code on the shown page.
4. You are almost done! Your account was created successfully. Now you can login with your phone number.
5. Search for a job nearby. Then call the person seeking help and make your way.
6. That's it! Deliver the order. Please make sure to follow the behaviour rules which can be found [here](https://github.com/machbarschaft/machbarschaft/blob/master/Verhaltensempfehlungen_f√ºr_MACHBAR_EINKAUF.pdf).

## Behind the scenes
Are you interested in how we work and which tools we use? Those are a few of them:

- Figma (for creating and designing the the wireframes)
- Trello (for task management)
- Firebase (as a backend)

## Next steps
This is what we plan to do next:

- Add the missing logic for starting and finishing a job
- Display the jobs to be done on the map
- Improve the user interface
- Implement Passbase to verify users
- Add more account actions such as edit account, delete account etc.
- Gamification of order fulfillment process to reward users
